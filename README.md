# CouponAcceptancePredictor
## This ML project aims at predicting if a particular customer will accept the coupon if he is the driver.

## The dataset was obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/mathurinache/invehicle-coupon-recommendation).

This data was collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The survey describes different driving scenarios including the destination, current time, weather, passenger, etc., and then ask the person whether he will accept the coupon if he is the driver.
